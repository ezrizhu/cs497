# sh

When writing POSIX compliant scripts for usually systems purposes. We tend to
use /bin/sh as our shabang. However, they're usually just symlinks to other
shell interpreters. Most of the time it is bash with restricted shell (see man
1 bash, under Restricted Shell).

However in other times, it may be to busybox, or dash.
