# Reproduction

We can reproduce our experiments with Vagrant and Ansible.
Vagrant is responsible for spinning up the VMs that we want, and Ansible is to
run the experiments on these machines.

Ansible will read from the inventory file generated by Vagrant.

Currently, the Vagrant file is configured to use the [libvirt
provider](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt). However, you can
also use the VirtualBox provider that's provided by Vagrant by default.

First, please ensure Ansible, Vagrant, and the Vagrant Provider that you're
using is installed and setup.

Second, clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ezrizhu/cs497.git`

To spin up the Vagrant environment and run the ansible playbook, simply run
`sudo vagrant up`.

You can also easily modify the array of distros that you want to test on by
editing the `Vagrantfile`.

You can also modify the array of tests that you want to run by editing
`playbook.yml`.

After that is complete, the outputs of all of our experiments will be under
`out/`.

When you are done running the experiments, run `vagrant destroy -f` to remove
all the VMs Vagrant created.
