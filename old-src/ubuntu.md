# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is also installed via
[debootstrap](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debootstrap).

All of the source code for Ubuntu, as well as all the OS divergences from Debian
and the mainline kernel, can be found on their [git
server](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux)

For example, the [vm_max_map_count](vmmaxmap.md) issue was patched in Ubuntu's
[procps package](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/procps)

Their fork of the Linux kernel can also be found
[here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux).
