# Debian

Debian is installed via [debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap)
[source](https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap).

A good amount of modifications to the kernel by the Debian team can be found in
their [linux repo](https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/tree/master/debian/patches/debian)

Their changes for other packages that Debian ships with can be found also in
[their gitlab](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/). Such as
[procps](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/procps).
