RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is one of the most popular Linux distribution
developed by Red Hat. CentOS was one of the most common, free Linux distro until
it was discontinued by Red Hat. Rocky Linux emerged to become it's community
maintained successor. Fedora is also a community maintained desktop orientated
rhel derivative. Oracle and Alma linux are both also rhel derivatives.

Debian is another one of the most popular Linux distributions, it is community
maintained, with Ubuntu being one of the very popular corporate supported
derivative. 

Alpine Linux is another community maintained Linux distribution that is focused
on simplicity. It uses a busybox instead of coreutils, and musl libc instead of
glibc. It is very popular in container runtimes as it is very light weight.

Lastly, Arch and Gentoo are both power user focused Linux distributions that
offers an incredible amount of user customization. They are both quite different
as well.
