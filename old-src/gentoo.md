# Gentoo

The Gentoo base image comes from the [stage3
tarball](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Stage_file). Which is built with
[Catalyst](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst) using [spec
files](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst#Specs_files).

They're all highly customizable and different. You can find the spec files in
the [catalyst repo](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/catalyst.git/)

That said, if your user uses Gentoo, they are hopefully competent enough to make their own
patch to your software.
